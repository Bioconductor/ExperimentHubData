# Overview

`ExperimentHubData` provides tools to add or modify resources in 
Bioconductor's `ExperimentHub`. This 'hub' houses curated data from courses,
publications or experiments.  The resources are generally not files of raw data 
(as can be the case in `AnnotationHub`) but instead are `R` / `Bioconductor` 
objects such as GRanges, SummarizedExperiment, data.frame etc.  Each resource 
has associated metadata that can be searched through the `ExperimentHub` client interface.


# Resources

## Add new resources 

Resources are contributed to `ExperimentHub` in the form of a package.  The
package contains the resource metadata, man pages, vignette and any supporting
`R` functions the author wants to provide.  This is a similar design to the
existing `Bioconductor` experimental data packages except the data are
uploaded to AWS S3 buckets instead of stored in the data/ directory of the
package.

New packages should be submitted to the `Bioconductor` tracker and will
go through the usual package review process. Contact packages@bioconductor.org 
for more information.

### Software package

When a resource is downloaded from `ExperimentHub` the associated software
package is loaded in the workspace making the man pages and vignettes readily
available. Because documentation plays an important role in understanding these
curated resources please take the time to develop clear man pages and a
detailed vignette. These documents provide essential background to the user and
guide appropriate use the of resources.

Below is an outline of package organization. The files listed are required
unless otherwise stated.

* inst/extadata/
    - metadata.csv

    This file contains the metadata for each resource to be added to
    `ExperimentHub`. The required column names and data types are specified in 
    the `ExperimentHubData::readMetadataFromCsv()` function. See 
    ?`readMetadataFromCsv` for details.

* inst/scripts/
    - make-data.R

    Script describing the steps involved in making the data object(s). This
    includes where the data were downloaded from, how they were processed
    and how the final R object was made. Include a description of any
    processing steps performed outside of `R` with third party software.

    - make-metadata.R

    Script to make the metadata.csv file located in inst/extdata of the 
    package. See ?`readMetadataFromCsv` for a description of expected fields 
    and data types.  `readMetadataFromCsv()` can be used to validate the 
    metadata.csv file before submitting the package.

* vignettes/
    - One or more vignettes describing analysis workflows. 

* man/
    - package man page 
 
    The package man page serves as a landing point and should briefly describe
    all resources associated with the package. It is recommended (but not
    required) that each resource have a dedicated man page.

* R/
    - optional functions

### Data objects

Data are not formally part of the software package and are uploaded separately
to AWS S3. When a package is submitted for review the author is 
given access to an S3 bucket and is responsible for uploading the resource(s) 
using AWS command line interface (CLI), e.g.,

    $ aws --profile username s3 cp dataobject s3://experimenthub/packagename --acl public-read


## Modify existing resources

Existing resources may need updating because of a bug fix or because the
original data have been re-processed with updated software. There are two parts
to each resource and they can be updated together or separately: the metadata 
in the `ExperimentHub` database and the data object in the AWS S3 bucket.

### Metadata only

Package maintainer:

    * update metadata.csv with modified information; the 'version' field for the
      resource stays the same

    * bump the package version

    * commit the new package version to svn/git

ExperimentHub client side:

    * when an EH package version is bumped the ExperimentHub
      maintainer is notified

    * ExperimentHub maintainer modifies metadata in database

    * ExperimentHub() downloads new metadata based on database timestamp

    * previously downloaded resources are not a problem (have not changed)

### Metadata and data objects 

Package maintainer:

    * update metadata.csv with modified information; the 'version' field for the
      resource is bumped 

    * bump the package version

    * commit the new package version to svn/git
 
    * upload new resource to S3

ExperimentHub client side:

    * when an EH package version is bumped the ExperimentHub
      maintainer is notified

    * ExperimentHub maintainer adds new metadata to database

    * ExperimentHub() downloads new metadata based on database timestamp

    * previously downloaded resources have separate 'EH' ids from the new
      versions and are not a problem


## Remove old resources

TBD


# `ExperimentHub_docker`

The [ExperimentHub_docker](https://github.com/Bioconductor/ExperimentHub_docker)
offers an isolated test environment for inserting / extracting metadata records
in the `ExperimentHub` database. The README in the package explains how to
set up the Docker and inserting records is done with
`ExperimentHub::addResources()`.

In general this level of testing should not be necessary when submitting
a package with new resources. The best way to validate record metadata is to 
read inst/extdata/metadata.csv with `ExperimentHubData::readMetadataFromCsv()`.
If that is successful the metadata is ready to go.
