# Overview

`ExperimentHubData` provides tools to add or modify resources in 
Bioconductor's `ExperimentHub`. This 'hub' houses curated data from courses,
publications or experiments.  The resources are generally not files of raw data 
(as can be the case in `AnnotationHub`) but instead are `R` / `Bioconductor` 
objects such as GRanges, SummarizedExperiment, data.frame etc.  Each resource 
has associated metadata that can be searched through the `ExperimentHub` client interface.

# Submit new resources

Resources are contributed to `ExperimentHub` in the form of a package.  The
package contains the resource metadata, man pages, vignette and any supporting
`R` functions the author wants to provide.  This is a similar design to the
existing `Bioconductor` experimental data packages except the data are
stored in AWS S3 buckets instead of the data/ directory of the package.

New packages should be submitted to the `Bioconductor` tracker and will
go through the usual package review process. Contact packages@bioconductor.org 
for more information.

## Software package

When a resource is downloaded from `ExperimentHub` the associated software
package is loaded in the workspace making the man pages and vignettes readily
available. Because documentation plays an important role in understanding these
curated resources please take the time to develop clear man pages and a
detailed vignette. These documents provide essential background to the user and
guide appropriate use the of resources.

Below is an outline of package organization. The files listed are required
unless otherwise stated. 

* inst/extadata/
    - metadata.csv: 
    This file contains the metadata in the format of one row per resource
    to be added to the `ExperimentHub` database. The file should be generated
    from the code in inst/scripts/make-metadata.R where the final data are
    written out with write.csv(..., row.names=FALSE). The required column 
    names and data types are specified in 
    `ExperimentHubData::readMetadataFromCsv()`. See ?`readMetadataFromCsv` for 
    details.

* inst/scripts/
    - make-data.R: 
    A script describing the steps involved in making the data object(s). This
    includes where the original data were downloaded from, pre-processing,
    and how the final R object was made. Include a description of any
    steps performed outside of `R` with third party software.

    - make-metadata.R: 
    A script to make the metadata.csv file located in inst/extdata of the 
    package. See ?`readMetadataFromCsv` for a description of expected fields 
    and data types.  `readMetadataFromCsv()` can be used to validate the 
    metadata.csv file before submitting the package.

* vignettes/

    One or more vignettes describing analysis workflows. 

* man/

    package man page: 
    The package man page serves as a landing point and should briefly describe
    all resources associated with the package. 
 
    resource man pages: 
    It is recommended (but not required) that each resource have a dedicated 
    man page.

* R/

    Optional functions to enhance data exploration.

* DESCRIPTION / NAMESPACE

    The package should depend on and fully import ExperimentHub.
    Package authors are encouraged to use the ExperimentHub::listResources() and 
    ExperimentHub::loadResource() functions in their man pages and vignette.
    These helpers are designed to facilitate data discovery within a specific
    package vs within all of ExperimentHub.


## Data objects

Data are not formally part of the software package and are uploaded separately
to AWS S3. When a package is submitted for review a new AWS S3 bucket is
created with the same name as the package. The author is given access to the
bucket and is responsible for uploading the resource(s) using AWS command line
interface (CLI), e.g.,

    $ aws --profile username s3 cp dataobject s3://experimenthub/packagename --acl public-read


# Add additional resources

Multiple versions of the data can be added to the same package as they
become available. Be sure the title is descriptive and reflects the
distinguishing information such as genome build Adding more resources of the same typeto an existing package requires the following steps:

* upload the new data to the same S3 bucket

* update make-metadata.R with the new metadata information

* re-generate the metadata.csv file

* bump package version and commit to svn/git

Contact maintainer@bioconductor.org with any questions.

# Bug fixes 

A bug fix may involve a change to the metadata, data resource or both. A change
to the data in S3 can be done by the package author but a change to the
metadata in the database must be done by someone on the Bioconductor Core team.

## Update the resource 

* upload the new file to the same S3 bucket; the new file must have the same 
  name as the original

## Update the metadata

* notify maintainer@bioconductor.org that you need to commit a metadata
  change

* update make-metadata.R with modified information

* regenerate metadata.csv

* bump the package version and commit to svn/git

# Remove resources

When a resource is removed from ExperimentHub the 'status' field in the 
metadata is modified to explain why they are no longer available. Once
this status is changed the ExperimentHub() constructor will not list the 
resource among the available ids. An attempt to extract the resource with 
'[[' and the EH id will return an error along with the status message.

To remove a resource from ExperimentHub contact maintainer@bioconductor.org.

# `ExperimentHub_docker`

The [ExperimentHub_docker](https://github.com/Bioconductor/ExperimentHub_docker)
offers an isolated test environment for inserting / extracting metadata records
in the `ExperimentHub` database. The README in the package explains how to
set up the Docker and inserting records is done with
`ExperimentHub::addResources()`.

In general this level of testing should not be necessary when submitting
a package with new resources. The best way to validate record metadata is to 
read inst/extdata/metadata.csv with `ExperimentHubData::readMetadataFromCsv()`.
If that is successful the metadata are ready to go.
